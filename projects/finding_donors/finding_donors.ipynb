    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most 50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "**Please note** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "* the model is typically easily understandable because the relations of features and output labels are usually intuitive enough to interpret; it doesn't have any assumption (e.g., linearity, normal distribution) in the data. It performs well when simple interpretation is required and not too many features in the input are present (it's not a strong feature selector)\n",
    "* it tends to overfit for problems with many features; it has relatively higher errors; it tends to be sensitive to training data variance. By design the features are considered dependent (interacting) with one another, so if there is a use case in which features are largely independent, the model would be slow to train (errors would be difficult to converge)\n",
    "* Since this feels like a market segmentation problem, with demographic features that are categorical or numerical, DT seems like a reasonably good solution to model this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its application domain is similar to DT because Random Tree is essentially an ensemble of weaker DT models with select features and combines them to make a stronger model. So it is then capable of solving data application problems where similar characteristics in data exist\n",
    "* It alleviates DT's weakness of overfitting and not being able to deal with training data variance (bias) by working on different subsets of features and different subsets of training data\n",
    "* By design RF is like rolling many DTs into one model, so it may or may not be slower to train; also due to the complexity that arises from polling and selection, the intuition to explain the model can get lost\n",
    "* Because of its robustness over DT, and the similar problem  as DT's, it's definitely worth trying\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Document or text classification such as a spam filter is a classic problem to solve with Naive Bayes models. In these problems, words or tokens are examined as features that occur within certain frequencies within different output labels. Naive Bayes models attempt to assign a probability to a document containing some of the features being labeled one way or another.\n",
    "* It is pretty easy to implement and very fast to train - linear time to the size of feature set and number of data points - so it doesn't suffer dimensionality issue; when using a custom solution, when new training data comes in, it's easier to update the model (instead of retrain) by just calculating feature probabilities and category probabilities. It works well in situations where data is more often discrete than continuous and models require frequent updating\n",
    "* If all the features are continuous rather than discrete, it would have to know the probability distribution of the data (assuming Gaussian but it's not always so, so we would require knowledge of the pdf); also the naive assumption of feature independence, although mostly working, may not work well when there are features that are strongly correlated - in this case, the model might result in failure to produce good categorical probabilities.\n",
    "* This problem has a few features of continuous values and most features of discrete values. With age, education, work-hours, we can mostly assume Gaussian distribution, with capital gain/loss due to the high bin value at 0, we may not be able to use Gaussian but since these are just two features of >100 features, I'm willing to try this model out first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVM can be applied to quite many classification problems, such as those for text, images, OCR and bioinformatics.\n",
    "* It has regularization parameters like C or gamma for both linear and nonlinear classifications that force one to think about overfitting; its nonlinear kernel tricks provide some neat solutions that provides good margin during split.\n",
    "* A single SVM only solves a binary classification problem. In order to classify multiple categories, one would need to train multiple SVMs. Also the SVM is not by design best suited for discrete data types although with proper preprocessing SVM does not care if a feature is discrete or not. \n",
    "* This problem calls for binary classifcation, which SVM is good for. I'm hoping SVM's ability to consider margin of error would result in an appropriately fitting solution.\n",

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction.

    "In short, the AdaBoost model I choose uses 50 different splits of the training data and then combine these splits up to give a final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diving down a bit deeper - during each of the 50 splits, we ask a single yes/no question. The question we choose to ask, once answered, should yield the most amount of information, i.e., being able to result in as accurately as possible a split of >50K people and <=50K people out of this specific data subset. After this split, we review the result, and put some emphasis of the incorrectly categorized people so that during the next split, we will pay a bit more attention to try to get those incorrectly labeled people correct this time. Rinse and repeat, for another 48 times in total. We also keep track of the accuracy each time when we perform the split exercise. The accuracy is tied to a weighting. Then we give higher weight to the splits with higher accuracy and lower weight to the splits with lower accuracy and finally combine the splits at these weights so that the entire training data set can be split using the synthesized split  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we are able to train a model that reaches 0.86 accuracy (i.e., we are 86% correct when making predictions with this model) and a F-score of 0.72 on test data, which is significantly better than employing no model at all (which predicts that no one makes >50K - Accuracy score: 0.25, F-score: 0.29). F-score is a score summarizing the precision and recall rate of our model, as with the accuracy, the closer to 1, the better."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "* the final model's scores have dropped by some: Accuracy: 0.8196, F-score: 0.6319 compared to the original model when all features are used 0.8678/0.7424. \n",
    "* If training time was a factor, I would use the reduced-feature data to train my model. Because although the accuracy and the F-score suffers somewhat, the model still retains a large portion of the explanatory power with the reduced feature set. A parsimonious model with a decent explanatory power should be a better model in that we are lower our chance to overfit while improving the training time so we can do grid search more efficiently for an even better model.\n"
